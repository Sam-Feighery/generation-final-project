## Ways of Working

## Agile Methogology

How are you going to operate efficiently as a team?

Will you have a daily standup?
As a team We will have a daily standup with each team member giving an update on what trello ticket they plan to work on,

Will you have retrospectives?


How will you structure your retro?

How will you decide to split the workload?
During standup's we will assess what is currently on our trello board and decide together who will take on a ticket, this person will be responsible for updating the whole team with their progress  

What methods of communication will you use?

Will you use different git branches to create and test features in?

Will use make use of GitHub's Pull Request feature so that other members can review your code?

## Development process
We will be using Github as version control and we will have multiple branches to work on as we create the app. <br>
Alpha aka main will be our main branch and it will house our lastest *tested* version of our program   
Beta will contain our latest work on and we will also use this branch for testing purposes.

While working on new features, each team member will create a github branch under the beta branch using a self-explanatory name, 
once 

## Definition of done

## Team principles
Follow up on actions – if we say we’re going to do something, we do it. 
Be on time – meetings start on the time they’re scheduled. If we’re late, we send a message beforehand to let other team members know.
Respect each other – we’re all different. We respect that.
Get stuff done – there’s a time and a place for planning and strategizing. Once a strategic decision has been made and we’re ready to go, we move fast and get stuff done.
Be comfortable with ambiguity – people yearn for certainty. We resist the urge to push for everything to be certain and we’re comfortable saying ‘I don’t know’ until we find out more.
The 5 minute rule – complaining is OK. But only for 5 minutes. After that we strive come up with a suggestion on how to improve the situation.
