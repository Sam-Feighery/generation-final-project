## About
This is a software for a client, cafe business owner with multiple offline stores. The client's exisiting software generates daily sales data at a single store and does not provide compiled data of all stores to provide the overview of whole business performance and makes it hard to draw valuable insight such as how to target customers and the best-selling products. This software will deliver ETL pipeline; extracting sales data from client's source, transforming data, and loading on client's data warehouse. 

> **Current Client Setup**
- CSV file for each branch
- File Generation Time: 8 p.m
- Daily, Weekly, Montlhy Reports (on sales, other business metrics)
- Time-consuming Collation of all CSV files

> **Vision**
- The new software should load CSV file on Cloud every night.
- The new software should have ETL pipeline.
- The new software should have monitoring system.

# Elevator Pitch:

**the** new software
